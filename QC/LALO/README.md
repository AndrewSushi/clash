# AndrewSushi's comprehensive queen charge lalo (QC LALO) guide

This is my comprehensive guide on queen charge lalo specifically for town halls 15 and 16. 

First off I would like to note that this is not and end all be all guide, this is meant to teach the basics up until the advanced of the strategy. I would also like to preface that I am not a pro or anywhere near it, but I have had a lot of success in legends league and CWL so I thought I'd like to share my thoughts. This guide will go through all aspects that comprise the attack strategy and will be sectioned for ease of understanding.

1. Why this attack works and the brief overview

QC LALO is an attack strategy that simply put, has the queen charge into the base with healers and uses lava hounds and balloons to take out the rest of the base. This attack works because the queen charge is a very strong method that can allow you to take down a huge portion of the base with very little troop cost. The only issue is that it takes a while to go through the base which is why you need a quick method to take out the rest of the base. That's where LALO comes in. The lava hounds are used to tank for the balloons and set off traps, while the loons fly through and destroy the remaining defences. 

2. Main objectives of the attack

The main objectives of the attack can be broken down to specific parts of the attack. 

Queen Charge:
The most important thing by far for the queen charge is to set the appropriate pathing for the lalo to come in and take down the rest of the base. On top of that, she also needs to take down key defences such as the clan castle, town hall, monolith, multi target infernos, and scatter shots. Those defences are important because they are able to quickly take down the lalo if left standing. These are the basics and I will go into further detail later on. 

Lalo:
Take down the remaining defences. 

As you can tell with this, the queen does most of the work. That's because the queen charge is the most important part of the attack. If your queen goes down too early or goes the wrong way, it will be significantly more difficult to get the 3 star.

3. How to plan the attack

When planning the attack, you want to take a look at where you can send in your queen and what value will she get. Now the most important thing to remember, is that queen charging is stronger on certain bases and weaker on others. For example, ring bases and anti 2 star bases are very tough to queen charge. This is because the town hall is central, the important defences and surrounding the town hall, and most importantly, it's harder to bring the queen on the inside because of the base's natural tendency to walk around the core.
